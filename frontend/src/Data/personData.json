  "about": "Hi there, my name is Alexander. I’m originally from SoCal and moved to San Francisco in 2017. I graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in Computer Science, and am now a Software Engineer on Apple News. I spend a lot of my free time on personal projects and exploring San Francisco, usually on a onewheel, and when I have the opportunity I love to travel."
