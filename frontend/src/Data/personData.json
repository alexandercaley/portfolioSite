  "about": "Hi there! My name is Alexander. In 2017 I moved from Glendale, CA to San Francisco. While pursuing my degree in computer science I spent plenty of time working on full stack native and web applications along with backend services to build my skillset.\nSince then I've graduated and am working at Apple as an iOS Software Engineer. I spend a lot of my free time on personal projects and exploring San Francisco, usually on a onewheel, and when I have the opportunity I love to travel."
