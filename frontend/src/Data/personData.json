  "about": "Hi there, my name is Alexander. I’m originally from SoCal and moved to San Francisco in 2017. I recently graduated from San Francisco State University with a degree in Computer Science. While pursuing my degree I spent plenty of time working on full stack native and web applications along with backend services to build my skillset.\nSince then I've graduated and am working at Apple as an iOS Software Engineer. I spend a lot of my free time on personal projects and exploring San Francisco, usually on a onewheel, and when I have the opportunity I love to travel."
